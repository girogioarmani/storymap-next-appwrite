# Delete Confirmation Security Feature

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Added a comprehensive delete confirmation dialog system that requires users to type "I understand" before deleting critical items. This prevents accidental data loss and ensures users are fully aware of the consequences.

---

## Features

### 1. Type-to-Confirm Pattern
Users must type **"I understand"** (case insensitive) to enable the delete button. This creates a deliberate pause and forces users to acknowledge the action.

### 2. Clear Warnings
Each dialog shows:
- ⚠️ Warning icon with red color scheme
- Item name being deleted (highlighted)
- Specific consequences based on item type
- "This action cannot be undone" message

### 3. Context-Specific Consequences

**Epic Deletion:**
- All user journeys will be deleted
- All steps will be deleted  
- All stories will be deleted

**Journey Deletion:**
- All steps will be deleted
- All stories will be deleted

**Step Deletion:**
- All stories in this step will be deleted

**Release Deletion:**
- Stories will be moved to backlog
- Release planning will be lost

**Story Deletion:**
- Story details will be permanently lost

---

## Implementation

### New Component
Created `components/ui/delete-confirmation-dialog.tsx`:
- Reusable dialog component
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Handles loading states
- Auto-resets on close

### Updated Components

**1. Epic Selector** (`components/storymap/epic-selector.tsx`)
- Replaced `confirm()` with `DeleteConfirmationDialog`
- Shows epic name and cascade delete warning

**2. Journey Selector** (`components/storymap/journey-selector.tsx`)
- Replaced `confirm()` with `DeleteConfirmationDialog`
- Shows journey name and impact on steps/stories

**3. Step Column** (`components/storymap/step-column.tsx`)
- Replaced `confirm()` with `DeleteConfirmationDialog`
- Shows step name and story deletion warning

**4. Release Lane** (`components/storymap/release-lane.tsx`)
- Replaced `confirm()` with `DeleteConfirmationDialog`
- Shows release name and backlog movement notice

---

## Usage Example

```tsx
<DeleteConfirmationDialog
  title="Delete Epic"
  description="This will permanently delete this epic and all of its associated data."
  itemName={epic.name}
  itemType="Epic"
  onConfirm={async () => {
    const result = await deleteEpic(epicId);
    if (result.success) {
      onRefresh();
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Dialog title |
| `description` | string | Main warning message |
| `itemName` | string | Name of item being deleted |
| `itemType` | 'Epic' \| 'Journey' \| 'Step' \| 'Release' \| 'Story' | Type for context-specific warnings |
| `onConfirm` | () => Promise<void> | Async function to execute on confirmation |
| `children` | React.ReactNode | Optional custom trigger button |

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Accidental Clicks**
The type-to-confirm pattern requires deliberate action, preventing "oops" moments from misclicks.

### 2. **Forces Acknowledgment**
Users must read and acknowledge the specific consequences before proceeding.

### 3. **Clear Communication**
Context-specific warnings ensure users know exactly what will be deleted.

### 4. **Cognitive Pause**
The act of typing creates a moment for users to reconsider the action.

### 5. **Audit Trail Ready**
The pattern supports adding logging or audit trails in the future.

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - this is purely an enhancement to existing functionality.

### Behavioral Changes
- **Before**: Single `confirm()` dialog
- **After**: Enhanced dialog with type-to-confirm
- **User Impact**: Slightly more friction, but much safer

### Rollback
If needed, revert to `confirm()` calls:
```tsx
if (!confirm('Delete this item?')) return;
```

5. **Handle errors gracefully** in onConfirm callback
