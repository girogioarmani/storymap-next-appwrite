# SPIDR Modal Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Stories Not Persisting in Modal
**Problem:** When creating THEN and OR stories in the SPIDR breakdown modal, they would disappear immediately after creation.

**Root Cause:** The `onSuccess()` callback was triggering a parent component refresh that would re-render the entire story map, causing the modal to lose its local state and revert to stale data.

**Solution:** Removed the `onSuccess()` call during story creation/deletion and instead only call it when the modal closes:
```typescript
// During story creation:
if (result.success) {
  await loadBreakdownStories(); // Reload only modal state
  // Don't call onSuccess() - prevents parent refresh
}

// When modal closes:
const handleOpen = async (isOpen: boolean) => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    onSuccess?.(); // Now refresh the parent
  }
};
```

**Result:** Stories now persist in the modal throughout the editing session. Parent is only refreshed when you close the modal.

### 2. ‚úÖ Modal Too Small
**Problem:** The SPIDR breakdown modal was cramped with limited space for horizontal scrolling.

**Changes Made:**
- Width: `max-w-[95vw]` ‚Üí `max-w-[98vw] w-[98vw]`
- Height: `max-h-[90vh]` ‚Üí `max-h-[95vh] h-[95vh]`
- Column width: `w-[280px]` ‚Üí `w-[320px]`

**Result:** Much more comfortable workspace with better visibility for complex breakdowns.

### 3. ‚úÖ Added SPIDR Tooltips
**Problem:** Users didn't have guidance on how to use SPIDR breakdown methodology.

**Solution:** Added a help icon (‚ùì) in the header with comprehensive tooltip containing:

#### SPIDR Breakdown Guide:

**üí° Spike - Research & Exploration**
- Time-boxed investigations
- Proof of concepts
- Learning needed before implementation

**üõ§Ô∏è Path - Alternative Workflows**
- Different user journeys or flows
- Happy path, error cases, edge cases

**üñ•Ô∏è Interface - UI Variations**
- Different interfaces or devices
- Presentation layers (mobile, desktop, API)

**üóÑÔ∏è Data - Data Scenarios**
- Different data states or sources
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)

**‚öñÔ∏è Rules - Business Logic**
- Different business rules
- Validations
- Conditional logic paths

#### Usage Instructions:
- Each column = a sequential THEN step
- Within each column = OR alternatives
- Drag stories to reorder priorities

**Result:** Users now have contextual help without leaving the modal.

## üí° SPIDR Methodology Reference

**When to use each type:**

- **Spike** when you need to research or explore unknowns
- **Path** when there are multiple user journeys
- **Interface** when supporting multiple devices/platforms
- **Data** when handling different data scenarios
- **Rules** when implementing conditional business logic

**Rule of Thumb:** If a story takes more than 1-2 days, consider breaking it down with SPIDR!
