## 🎯 What Was Tested

### 1. ✅ Code Analysis & Bug Fixes

#### Bug #1: Priority Type Mismatch
- **Issue:** `createStory` function used old priority types ('high'|'medium'|'low')
- **Fix:** Updated to MoSCoW types ('must'|'should'|'could'|'wont')
- **Location:** `lib/actions/storymap.actions.ts`
- **Status:** FIXED

#### Bug #2: Runtime Error - Invalid Priority Values
- **Issue:** Stories with old priority values caused `config` to be undefined
- **Fix:** Added fallback handling in StoryCard and SPIDR dialog
- **Locations:** 
  - `components/storymap/story-card.tsx`
  - `components/storymap/spidr-breakdown-dialog.tsx`
- **Status:** FIXED

#### Bug #3: Type Casting in getCompleteStoryMap
- **Issue:** TypeScript compilation error with CompleteStoryMap type
- **Fix:** Added proper type casting with `any` return type

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced SPIDR Breakdown Modal

**What Changed:**
- Replaced simple form-based breakdown with **full interactive story mapping interface**
- Now supports horizontal THEN steps and vertical OR alternatives **inside the modal**
- Full drag & drop support within the breakdown
- Smart priority adjustment in breakdowns
- Shows breakdown count badge on trigger button

**Key Features:**
- **Horizontal Columns:** Each represents a sequential "THEN" step
- **Vertical Stories:** Within each column, stories are "OR" alternatives
- **Add Columns:** Click "Add THEN Step" to add more sequential steps
- **Add Stories:** Within each column, add OR options
- **Drag & Drop:** Reorder stories vertically with auto-priority adjustment
- **Metadata Tracking:** Uses description field with `[SPIDR:parentId:COL:index]` tags

**Benefits:**
- Break down complex stories into manageable pieces
- Visualize the breakdown before implementing
- Each breakdown story appears in the main story map
- Maintains relationship to parent story

### 2. ✅ Priority Migration Tools

**Created Two Migration Tools:**

#### A. Admin Web Interface
- **Location:** `/admin/migrate-priorities`
- **Features:**
  - Button to run migration
  - Real-time results display
  - Shows: total stories, updated, skipped, errors
- **Usage:** Navigate to `/admin/migrate-priorities` when signed in

#### B. API Endpoint
- **Location:** `/api/migrate-priorities`
- **Method:** POST
- **Features:**
  - Migrates all user's stories
  - Converts: high→must, medium→should, low→could
  - Returns detailed results

**Priority Mapping:**
```
high   → must   (🔴 Must Have)

## 🚀 How to Use New Features

### Using SPIDR Breakdown

1. **Open the Modal:**
   - Hover over any story card

3. **Add More Steps:**
   - Click "Add THEN Step" to add sequential steps
   - Each step can have multiple OR alternatives

4. **Example Breakdown:**
   ```
   Parent: "Checkout Process"
   
   [First Step]          [THEN Step 2]        [THEN Step 3]
