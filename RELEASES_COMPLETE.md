## 💡 Quick Tips

### Organizing Your Story Map:
1. **Start with Backlog:** Create all stories first
2. **Then Add Releases:** Create MVP, Phase 1, Phase 2
3. **Assign Stories:** Move stories to appropriate releases
4. **Refine:** Adjust as priorities change

### Naming Conventions:
- Use emojis for visual distinction (🎯 MVP, 🚀 R1, ✨ R2)
- Keep names short and clear
- Add descriptions for context

### Best Practices:
- Keep MVP small and focused
- Group related features in same release
- Use backlog for "nice to have" items
- Review and adjust regularly

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Version:
- ✅ Stories default to backlog (manual assignment coming)
- ✅ No drag between releases yet (next feature)
- ✅ No release editing UI (delete/recreate for now)

### Not Issues (By Design):
- Backlog always shows at bottom ✅
- Empty releases show empty step columns ✅
- SPIDR stories hidden from main view ✅

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### `releases` Collection:
```typescript
{
  $id: string;
  name: string;              // "🎯 MVP"
  description: string;       // Optional details
  journeyId: string;         // Parent journey
  userId: string;            // Owner
  order: number;             // Display order
  createdAt: string;         // Timestamp
}
```

### `stories` Collection (Updated):
```typescript

  releaseId?: string;        // NEW: Optional release assignment

```
